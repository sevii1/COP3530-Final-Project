1. Download the files in a zip folder 
2. Unzip the folder in your preferred destination and load the files
as a new project in the Qt ide (can be done with any ide with widgets
but it's easiest if you have access to the Qt ide).
3. Change filepaths for the database file and the movie file (specifically in redblacktree.h) to the raw filepaths if necessary, for some reason our code didn't like the universal filepaths
4. Build and run from the Qt ide (or the ide of your choice).
